= Crux Kotlin DSL

A Kotlin DSL for Crux which enables pretty transactions and queries

== Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crux-labs/crux-kotlin-dsl.git
cd crux-kotlin-dsl
./gradlew build
cp build/libs/crux-kotlin-dsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar {your-project-deps-directory}
```

== Status

Pre-Alpha: This library is experimental. If you need a stable Java/Kotlin API, use the https://crux-doc.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/crux-javadoc/master/index.html[Crux Core Java API] directly for now.

== Releasing

To release a JAR to MavenCentral, you will need to follow three steps:

1. Create a GPG key
2. Create a `gradle.properties` file with your secrets
3. Build and Publish

=== (1) Create a GPG key

Follow the instructions here:
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/#generating-a-key-pair
...save your key's passphrase and revocation certificate in your password manager.

If you have trouble distributing your GPG key, try one of the servers listed in this tutorial:

=== (2) Create `gradle.properties` secrets

==== (2.a) Get your public key id:

[source,shell]
----
# Look for the key in '0xABCDEFGH' format.
# Use the 8-char 'ABCDEFGH' portion as 'signing.keyId' below.
gpg -K --keyid-format 0xSHORT
----

==== (2.b) Create a secret key ring file:

[source,shell]
----
# this requires your key's passphrase:
gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
----

==== (2.c) Create `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

This file will hold your secrets, which is why it's not in git.
See this Gradle doc for more details:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:signatory_credentials

.~/.gradle/gradle.properties
[source]
----
# File location: ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
signing.keyId=ABCDEFGH
signing.password=YOUR_PASSPHRASE
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/home/YOUR_USER/.gnupg/secring.gpg
ossrhUsername=YOUR_SONATYPE_JIRA_USERNAME
ossrhPassword=YOUR_SONATYPE_JIRA_PASSWORD
----

=== (3) Build and publish:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew test
./gradlew build jar javadocJar sourcesJar
./gradlew publish
----
