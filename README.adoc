= XTDB Kotlin DSL

A Kotlin DSL for XTDB which enables pretty transactions and queries

== Quickstart

Add `xtdb-kotlin-dsl` as a dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.xtdb:xtdb-kotlin-dsl:0.1.0")
    // ...
}
```

== Status

Pre-Alpha: This library is experimental. If you need a stable Java/Kotlin API, use the https://xtdb-api-docs.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/xtdb-javadoc/main/index.html[XTDB Core Java API] directly for now.

== Releasing

To release a JAR to MavenCentral, you will need to follow four steps:

1. Create a Sonatype user
2. Create a GPG key
3. Create a `gradle.properties` file with your secrets
4. Build and Publish

=== (1) Create a Sonatype user

As far as I can tell, there is no automated way for existing users to add new
users to GroupIds. There is https://oss.sonatype.org, which has some administrator
features but it would seem none of us are admins for the GroupId `pro.juxt`.

The process will unfortunately be somewhat manual. Create a JIRA user (yes, really)
on https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa[issues.sonatype.org]. Then
create a new JIRA ticket (yes, really) requesting "deployer" access to the `pro.juxt`
GroupId. A human being will be with you shortly.

=== (2) Create a GPG key

Follow the instructions here:
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/#generating-a-key-pair
...save your key's passphrase and revocation certificate in your password manager.

If you have trouble distributing your GPG key, try one of the servers listed in this tutorial:

=== (3) Create `gradle.properties` secrets

==== (3.a) Get your public key id:

[source,shell]
----
# Look for the key in '0xABCDEFGH' format.
# Use the 8-char 'ABCDEFGH' portion as 'signing.keyId' below.
gpg -K --keyid-format 0xSHORT
----

==== (3.b) Create a secret key ring file:

[source,shell]
----
# this requires your key's passphrase:
gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
----

==== (3.c) Create `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

This file will hold your secrets, which is why it's not in git.
See this Gradle doc for more details:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:signatory_credentials

.~/.gradle/gradle.properties
[source]
----
# File location: ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
signing.keyId=ABCDEFGH
signing.password=YOUR_PASSPHRASE
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/home/YOUR_USER/.gnupg/secring.gpg
ossrhUsername=YOUR_SONATYPE_JIRA_USERNAME
ossrhPassword=YOUR_SONATYPE_JIRA_PASSWORD
----

=== (4) Build and publish:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew test
./gradlew build jar javadocJar sourcesJar
./gradlew publish
----

=== (5) Release to Central:

Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories and check the box next to the repository you just published

Click "Close"

When the operation is complete, click "Release"
